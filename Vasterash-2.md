# Cloak - Part 2

Vasterash felt the silence in the chamber, it felt like the walls were closing in. The golden Demoanna looked at him, with pericing eyes.

"You are mistaken, Cloak. Leave this place, lest your rot spread to the rest of us.", she spat - the menace in the statement very clear - before getting up and leaving the dais, followed quickly by her sister. Igar sat in silence, quietly shaking his head. Vasterash could sense he had made a grave error of judgement by coming here this day - he clumsily bowed and made his way out of the chamber, his disgrace following in his wake.

Decending the steps quickly, he made his way back into the weaving passageways of the city itself - trying to somehow outrun the events that had just happened. Down an alley, up some steps, through a workhouse and past the weeping mounds near the brickworks. When he finally stopped he was thoroughly lost, his senses overwhelmed, he deprately needed to rest before deciding his next steps. He found himself absentmindedly walking through a small, mishapen, tavern door and standing next to crude bar made from a brownish waxy material.
